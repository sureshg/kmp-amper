# Grammar & Writing

When fixing grammar or rephrasing text:

## Do

1. **Keep it natural** - Match the user's original tone and style
2. **Fix what's broken** - Correct spelling, grammar, and clarity issues only
3. **Remove fluff** - Keep sentences direct and simple
4. **Preserve personality** - Maintain casual language, contractions, and the user's voice
5. **Show options** - Provide 1-2 variations if helpful
6. **Just show results** - Don't explain changes unless asked

## Don't

- Make it sound corporate or overly formal
- Add fancy vocabulary that wasn't there
- Change the meaning or remove technical details
- Make it sound AI-generated or robotic
