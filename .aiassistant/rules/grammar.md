# AI Rules: Grammar & Writing Cleanup

When asked to fix grammar or rephrase text:

1. **Keep it natural** - Don't over-polish. Match the user's original tone and style.
2. **Fix what's broken** - Correct spelling, grammar, and clarity issues only.
3. **No fluff** - Remove unnecessary words. Keep sentences direct and simple.
4. **Preserve personality** - Maintain casual language, contractions, and the user's voice.
5. **Show options** - Provide 1-2 variations if the original could go different directions.
6. **Don't explain** - Just show the cleaned-up version unless asked for reasoning.

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't make it sound corporate or overly formal
- Don't add fancy vocabulary that wasn't there
- Don't change the meaning or remove technical details
- Don't make it sound AI-generated or robotic
